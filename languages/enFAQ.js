	faqTitle: `FAQ for Patients:`,
	faqFirstElement: `What are dental implants?`,
	faqFirstElementText: `A dental implant is a small threaded post which
 functions as a substitute for a natural tooth root. A dental implant restores the physical
 appearance of the tooth and also its functionality by enabling the patient to chew food
 properly if he or she has one or a few teeth missing. FUTURE's implants are intended to fill
 mandibular and maxillary voids and to rehabilitate the mouth. Implants can provide
 substitution of a single tooth or a number of teeth.`,
	faqSecondElement: `Can everyone have tooth implantation?`,
	faqSecondElementText: `Every patient must be medically examined by the
 dentist in order to determine the appropriate location and medical procedure for the dental
 implantation. The dentist must be sure that there are no health risks and that there will
 not be any adverse effects on the recovery and healing of the bone or the soft tissues.

 If the patient is concerned about the osseous and soft tissue healing process, then the
procedure should be reconsidered. If a patient suffers connective tissue disorder, smokes,
 takes steroids or suffers from an osseous infection, extra care must be taken concerning
 dental implantation procedure.`,
	faqThirdElement: `How must implants be treated?`,
	faqThirdElementText: `Dental implants must be treated properly in order
 for them to last and ultimately substitute for the natural tooth.
 Implants that are improperly positioned or are inadequate for load-bearing, might break or
 cause mechanical failure. To reduce the risk of overload or implant fatigue, the dentist
 must position the implant and the denture carefully for every patient in order to prevent
 the negative effects of wear or tooth clenching. The dentist will review the potential
 implant position and angle prior to choosing to specify implants.`,
	faqFourthElement: `What is tooth restoration?`,
	faqFourthElementText: `In tooth restoration, dental implants are used as
 an ultimate substitute for a missing tooth (or missing teeth). FUTURE provides a complete
 product package which includes multiple rehabilitation parts and enables the dentist to
 reconstitute your natural smile.`,
